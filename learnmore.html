				<h2>Nature and role of Innovations</h2>
				<p>Innovation can be defined as the application of new ideas to the products, processes, or other aspects of the activities of a organization or society that lead to increased “value.” This “value” is defined in a broad way to include higher value added for the organization and
					also benefits to consumers or other firms. Two important definitions are:
					<br>
					<br> • Product innovation: the introduction of a new product, or a significant qualitative change in an existing product.
					<br> • Process innovation: the introduction of a new process for making or delivering goods and services.
					<br>
					<br> Some authors have emphasized a third category of innovation, that of organizational change within the firm, but we see this as being naturally included within the second category, as a type of process innovation.</p>
				<h2>Disruptive Opportunity</h2>
				<p>

				</p>
				One key to surviving in a world of disruption, where the external environment is changing at lightning speed, is to change the game internally. This requires accelerating your speed-of-execution as well as your agility to seize new opportunities. When
				a company can do both, it goes from just surviving to thriving. The capability to out-execute and disrupt is quickly becoming a critical competitive advantage for the 21st century company.
				<p>Although this may seem obvious it is by no means an easy task. The barriers to accelerating operational execution while at the same time innovating at a faster and faster rate to disrupt competitors are daunting. Most companies fail at one or the
					other. The primary reason for failure is that disruptive innovation requires a different set of skills than management execution.</p>
				<h2>Global Schools and Trends</h2>
				<p>We’re at a critical time for the digital economy. Digital is no longer the shiny front end of the organization – it’s integrated into every aspect of today’s companies. As digital technologies continue to transform the economy, many leaders are struggling
					to set a digital strategy, shift organizational structures, and remove the barriers that are keeping them from maximizing the potential impact of new digital technologies.</p>

				<h2>Fail Fast, Disrupt, Make Something People Want</h2>
				<p>A disruptive innovation is an innovation that creates a new market and value network and eventually disrupts an existing market and value network, displacing established market leaders and alliances. The term was defined and phenomenon analyzed by
					Clayton M. Christensen beginning in 1995.</p>
