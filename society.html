								<h2>Disruptive Innovation for Social Change</h2>
								While incumbent organizations may do a good job serving a particular group, they are unlikely ever to reach the far broader populations that would be satisfied by simpler offerings.<br>
								What’s required is expanded support for organizations that are approaching social-sector problems in a fundamentally new way and creating scalable, sustainable, systems-changing solutions. Their method, which we call “catalytic innovation,” shares principal features with Clayton Christensen’s disruptive-innovation model. Like disruptive innovations, which challenge industry incumbents by offering simpler, good-enough alternatives to an underserved group of customers, catalytic innovations can surpass the status quo by providing good-enough solutions to inadequately addressed social problems. Catalytic innovations are a subset of disruptive innovations, distinguished by their primary focus on social change, often on a national scale.
								<br>
								Disruptive innovations have had a major impact on industry structures, from travel to computer retailing to communications, and have often given rise to social change in the process. But the social changes caused by disruptive innovations are largely unintended; they are simply the by-products of pursuing a business opportunity. With catalytic innovations, however, social change is the primary objective.
